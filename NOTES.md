# Project Implementation Notes

## 1. Guiding Philosophy: Building for Production
This document provides a professional overview of the card management API's design and architecture. Every decision was guided by a single goal: to build a robust, secure, and maintainable application suitable for a production environment.

The following sections explain how we translated this philosophy into practice.

## 2. The Blueprint: A Clean and Scalable Architecture
A strong foundation is essential for a reliable application. We based ours on two core principles: separation of concerns and data integrity.

### The Service Layer: Our Core Principle
All business logic is encapsulated in a dedicated service layer (`CardService`), completely separate from the API views (`CardViewSet`).
- **Why it Matters:** This follows the **Single Responsibility Principle**. Views are only responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. Services are responsible for business rules, data manipulation, and provider integration. This makes the codebase easier to test, maintain, and reason about.

### Database Integrity with Atomic Transactions
The final step of creating a card—saving it to the database—is wrapped in `transaction.atomic()`.
- **Why it Matters:** This guarantees **data consistency**. If the database save fails for any reason (e.g., a constraint violation), the entire operation is rolled back, preventing corrupted data from ever being saved.

## 3. The Life of a Request: From Call to Card
To understand the system's resilience, let's follow the lifecycle of a request, from the initial API call to the final response, covering both success and failure.

### The "Happy Path": Proactive Validation
Even when the external provider returns a successful response, we practice **defensive coding** by proactively validating the data before we use it.
- **Strict Contract Enforcement:** We immediately check that critical fields, like `status`, are present. If not, we raise an error instantly, preventing data corruption.
- **Resilient Datetime Handling:** We ensure any `expiration_date` from the provider is timezone-aware and is not in the past. This prevents a common class of subtle bugs.

### Handling Failure: A Multi-Layered Defense
When things go wrong, we have a clear, three-layer strategy for handling the failure gracefully and securely.

#### Layer 1: The Provider Client (Catching Raw Errors)
- The process starts in `CardService` when it calls the provider. If the provider returns an HTTP error (e.g., a 400 or 500 status code), our `BankProviderClient` will raise a standard `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`.

#### Layer 2: The Service Layer (Raising Semantic Business Errors)
- `CardService` catches low-level exceptions (`requests.exceptions.HTTPError`) or spots validation failures (like an invalid color). It then translates these issues into a high-level, **semantic business exception** from `cards/exceptions.py`.
- **Examples:**
    - A client requesting a non-existent card ID raises a `CardNotFoundError`.
    - An HTTP 400 from the provider becomes a `UserNotRegisteredError`.
    - A client providing "blue" as a color raises an `InvalidInputError`.
    - The provider returning a card with a past expiration date raises an `InvalidCardDataError`.
    - An HTTP 500 from the provider becomes a `ProviderFailureError`.
- **The Logic:** This is a critical architectural decision. The service layer doesn't know about HTTP or JSON; it only knows about business failures. This **decouples our business logic** from the web layer, making it pure, reusable, and much easier to test.

#### A Note on Ambiguous Provider Errors
- **The Challenge:** The mock provider can return an HTTP 400 error for multiple reasons (e.g., an invalid user OR an invalid color). However, it returns the *same generic error* in both cases, without a specific error code in the response body that we can inspect.
- **Our Two-Part Solution:**
    1.  **Our First Line of Defense:** Before calling the provider, we perform our own validation on the user's input. For example, we check if the `color` is valid. This ensures we can immediately return a clear and specific `InvalidInputError` for common mistakes.
    2.  **A Sensible Default:** If our own validation passes but the provider still returns a 400 error, we must assume it's for the other likely reason: a problem with the user's account. We therefore raise a `UserNotRegisteredError`. This is the most robust and secure approach possible given the limitations of the mock provider.

#### Layer 3: The API View (Delivering Safe, Traceable Responses)
- The `CardViewSet` catches our custom `ServiceException`. It then uses the details from the exception to build a safe, structured JSON response for the client.
- **Safe & User-Friendly:** This prevents leaking internal details like stack traces. The user gets a clean error message.
- **Traceable for Developers:** Crucially, we generate a unique `trace_id` and include it in the error response. While the user sees a generic message, our internal logs would contain this `trace_id` alongside the full, detailed error from the provider. A developer can use this ID to find the exact cause of the problem instantly.

## 4. Verification: A Secure and Realistic Testing Strategy
Our testing strategy is designed to be comprehensive and, above all, secure.

### Testing Philosophy: Unit vs. Integration
- **Unit Tests (`test_card_service.py`):** These are fast, focused tests that validate the business logic within `CardService` in isolation.
- **Integration Tests (`test_cards_api.py`):** These tests validate the entire application stack, from the HTTP request down to the database, ensuring all layers are wired together correctly.

### Simulating Reality: How We Test the Provider
#### Testing Failure: Securely Mocking Errors
- **What:** We test error scenarios by directly mocking the provider client's behavior without sending a special `external_id` string through the API, as that would be a potential "backdoor".
- **How it Works:** In our tests, we use `mocker` to patch `BankProviderClient.create_card`. The test instructs the mock to raise a `requests.exceptions.HTTPError` with a specific status code (e.g., 400 or 500).
- **Why This is a Better Approach:**
    1.  **More Realistic:** It precisely simulates what the real provider client would do.
    2.  **Tests the Right Thing:** It verifies that our `CardService` correctly catches the `HTTPError` and translates it into the appropriate custom `ServiceException`.
    3.  **More Secure:** It removes the ability for an actor to trigger specific error paths by sending undocumented fields in an API request.

## 6. Conclusion and Future Considerations
The project demonstrates a professional, production-ready implementation of a modern web API. It is built on a foundation of clean architecture, robust error handling, and a comprehensive, secure testing strategy.

**Future Security Considerations (Out of Scope for this Evaluation):**
While the application logic is secure, a production deployment would require additional hardening, such as:
- **API Rate Limiting:** To prevent brute-force attacks and abuse.
- **DDoS Protection:** Typically handled by infrastructure services like AWS Shield or Cloudflare.
- **Advanced Input Sanitization:** To protect against a wider range of injection attacks.
